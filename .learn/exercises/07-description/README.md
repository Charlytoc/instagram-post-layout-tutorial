### Instructions

- **Use a `<span>` tag** to display the likes text. Example: `"Liked by 4GeeksAcademy, html5, Web and 100,000 others"`.
- **Add the post description inside a `<p>` tag**. Use a sample paragraph like `"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..."` and make sure the description is placed right below the likes section.
- **Style both sections with CSS:**
    - **Typography**: Use a readable font and an appropriate text size.
    - **Spacing**: Ensure there is enough space between the likes and the description to improve readability.
    - **Bold Text**: Apply `font-weight: bold;` to highlight the names in the likes section.
