Congratulations! You have completed your project and it is ready to be shared. Some of the things you learned throughout this guided tutorial were:

- **Structuring an HTML document** using tags like `<div>`, `<p>`, and `<span>`.
- **Applying CSS styles** to create an attractive and responsive design, using properties like `flexbox`, `margin`, `padding`, and background colors.
- **Designing visual components** that enhance the user experience, ensuring all elements are legible and well-aligned.
- **Organizing content** in a logical and accessible manner, using headings and other elements to improve presentation.
