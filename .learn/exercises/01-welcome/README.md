# `01` Welcome to the Instagram Post Creation Exercise with HTML and CSS!

## ðŸ’¬ Understanding the Project

In this exercise, we will create a web page that simulates an Instagram post using only HTML and CSS.  
This project will help you strengthen your understanding of basic web page structure with HTML and visual design with CSS. 

We will simulate the basic interface of a post, including:
- An image  
- Description text  
- Interactive buttons  
- Visual styles to give it the appearance of a real post
