# `07` Final design review

In this step, you will conduct a comprehensive review of the design to ensure it closely resembles the proposed Instagram post image.

### Instructions:

1. **Check Icon Alignment:** Ensure that the interaction icons are correctly aligned and evenly distributed at the bottom of the image.

2. **Review Image Size:** Make sure that the main image maintains its proportions and fills the entire width of the container.

3. **Adjust Colors and Margins:** Apply background colors, margins, and spacing that enhance the readability and overall appearance of the post.

4. **Review Text:** Ensure that all text (username, description, likes) is legible and properly aligned.

5. **Compare with Reference Image:** Use a reference image of the Instagram post to verify that the design resembles the original.
