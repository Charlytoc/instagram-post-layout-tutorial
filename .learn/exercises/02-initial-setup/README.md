# `02` Initial HTML Setup

In this first step, you will create the initial structure of your HTML document. Follow these instructions:

1. Create a file named `index.html`.
2. Add the basic HTML structure using the `html`, `head`, and `body` tags.
3. Create and link a `styles.css` file, which we will use later for styling.

This is the starting point for your Instagram page. ðŸš€
